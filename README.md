# Aviation-Dashboard
Federal Aviation Operational Integrity Dashboard.
A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to provide a comprehensive analysis of national flight performance, monitoring the reliability and efficiency of the U.S. airspace through real-time tracking of flight volumes, delays, and cancellations.

**Short discription**:
A data tool for tracking U.S. flight performance and reliability. Monitor real-time trends in total flights, delays, and cancellations. Analyze airline efficiency to drive data-informed aviation insights.

**Technical Stack**:
-> Data Visualization: Microsoft Power BI.

-> Data Processing: Power Query (M Language).

-> Analytical Engine: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

-> Data Source: CSV / Flat File Integration.

**Data Source**:
Source: 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations.

A comprehensive dataset of over 5 million U.S. domestic flights from 2015, detailing scheduled versus actual times to track delays, cancellations, and airline performance.

**Features/ Highlights**:

1.**Business Problem**: Aviation leaders struggle to fix delays because they lack a single, clear view of performance. This leads to high operational costs, inefficient scheduling, and poor passenger experiences.

2. **Goal of the Dashboard**: This tool centralizes millions of flight records to track reliability. It helps users quickly compare airline performance and identify exactly when the system is failing.

3. **Walk-through of Key Visuals**: The dashboard uses KPI cards to show Total Flights, Delays, and Cancellations at a glance. Interactive charts and filters then allow users to break these numbers down by airline or date to find specific issues.

4. **Business Impact and Insights**: By tracking these disruption rates, the dashboard enables data-driven decisions that reduce costs and improve flight efficiency. It transforms raw data into a strategic roadmap for better air travel.
